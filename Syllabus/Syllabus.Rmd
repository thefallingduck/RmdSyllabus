# Course description

Why do Sedimentology and Stratigraphy (GY306[W]) matter? Sediments house the record of climate at Earth's surface, influence climate through feedbacks, and house important resources. In this course you will learn how sediments are formed, moved, and preserved in the rock record. We will discuss the way that paleoenvironments are interpreted from observations of rocks on multiple scales. In addition, we will work together to improve your writing skills with a focus on a few of the genres of writing you may be expected to do as professional geologists.

# Writing requirements

For this class to fulfill the (W) requirements of USA, you will be doing a semester-long research project in an area related to sedimentology. To build your skills in discipline-specific writing, we will be doing smaller writing assignments throughout the semester. The final projects will be peer-reviewed, revised, and then submitted for final grading and assessment.

# Important Dates
August 29th - Last day to drop without WD\
October 11th - Midterm exam\
November 3rd - Last day to drop or withdraw. See the [Academic Calendar](https://www.southalabama.edu/academiccalendar/) for more information.\
December 11th 1:00 to 3:00 pm - Final Exam

\newpage

# Course goals

1.  Observe, describe, classify, and communicate about sediments and sedimentary rocks.

2.  Develop a framework for building hypotheses about the distributions of sediments, sedimentary structures, and sedimentary environments.

3.  Communicate sedimentary geology to audiences using different genres of writing.

4.  Read and summarize scientific papers focused on sedimentary geology and related fields.

# Class textbooks

We will have two books that you should have access to for the class this semester. The book on writing below will be referenced and discussed often. We will also refer to the general sedimentology and stratigraphy book.

# Student conduct

## Attendance policy

Students who complete less than 50% of assignments/exams will be assigned a failing (F) grade.

Review the 'Attendance and Absences Policy', in the Undergraduate and Graduate Bulletin for attendance and absences policy

## Grading

### Late policy
I will be grading assignments in batches to provide fair assessment to everyone. This means late work can be disruptive. The penalty for late work will be 20% a day after the first 24 hours late. If you have a reasonable excuse (illness, etc.) the late policy may be relaxed.

### Extra credit
Extra credit may be made available throughout the semester at my discretion.

Assignments will be returned within a week of submission.

```{r Grades_Table, echo=FALSE}

# Writing tasks
## Scaffolding tasks
Scaffolding writing tasks assigned to give you some practice and general feedback to improve your writing.

### Abstract 1

First attempt at writing an abstract using the Nature paragraph template.

### Figure Caption

Write the figure captions for several example figures using some literature examples. Learn to describe figures in text.

### Abstract 2

Write the abstract for a second paper using the feedback from the first abstract to improve your process.

### Peer Review

Peer review of preprint or publication using example template. The goal of this assignment is to focus on critiquing the logic put forward in the paper with suggestions for refining it.


## Semester project

Semester project outline of writing products.

### Project Story Summary

Short outline of proposed project that answers the following questions. (Based on S.B. Heard's book).\
1) What is the central question?\
2) Why is this question important?\
3) What data (variables) are needed to answer this question?\
4) What methods are used to get those data?\
5) What analysis must be applied for the data to answer this question?\
6) What results are likely?\
7) How can results answer the question?\
8) What does the answer tell us about the broader field?

### Proposal introduction draft

Carefully explain the knowledge that lead you to develop this hypothesis and clearly outline the hypothesis
to be tested. Consider these questions:
- What do we know about the question you are interested in studying?\
- What background knowledge do people need to assess if your hypothesis can be tested?\
- How could auxiliary hypotheses be tested?\
- What specific data are needed to test the hypothesis and is there a clear distinction between the hypothesis and alternatives?

### Proposal methods draft

This section outlines the required samples, locations, and data that must be collected to test your hypothesis.
Consider these questions:\
- Where will samples or field observations come from?\
- Will data be collected in the field or in a lab?\
- What instruments are needed to perform the measurements?\
- What difficulties may come from the interpretations of the measurements?\
- How many analyses are needed?

### Proposal intellectual merit draft

Create a section that specifically states how this proposal contributes to the field of research and is potentially
transformative (although this is not as important for the assignment.) Consider the following questions:\
- What will the potential next steps be beyond testing this hypothesis?\
- How could the findings of this work have impacts on other areas of research?

### Proposal broader impacts draft

This section summarizes how your work will benefit society. This could be through applications of your
discovery, training of individuals, or communication to people outside of the scientific community.\
- Does the research have an economic or societal benefit?\
- Does the work require the training of individuals?\
- How would this work benefit the university or community?

### Project first draft

Full proposal draft with figures. The important aspect of this submission is assessment of the research plan and justification.

### Project peer review

Review of a peer's proposal with the goal of improving the work by increasing clarity, readability and communication.

### Project final draft

Full, final project proposal with figures, time line and clear plan for work. Focus is on clearly communicating to your peers that the work is worth doing and that you can do it.

### Project presentation

Presentation of a peer's research proposal with a focus on justifying funding their project. The goal is to convince the audience that the project can be done and will have an important impact on society.

# On writing

## Revising written work

Nothing is perfect on the first draft. We all revise and rework our written creations for a variety of reasons. We may not communicate the point we want to get across to all readers. We may have forgotten or not known important pieces of information initially. The tone of the writing may be inappropriate for the audience. Word choice might obscure meaning. The only way we can make our writing better is by revising it based on constructive feedback from others or ourselves.

## Genres of Science writing

### Paper reviews

Critical but constructive critique of unpublished research papers. Informs the journal editor of how the work contributes to existing literature and provides guide to authors and the editor for improvement to the manuscript. Can be signed but often anonymous.

### Descriptive Reports

Descriptive reports are often made for industry or geological surveys. These describe the composition and structure of rocks in an area. Sometimes they include estimations of resource potentials or environmental impacts of industry.

### Research papers

These pieces of science writing typically test one or more closely related hypotheses in the context of existing scientific knowledge. Most have structure that is pre-defined including: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Figures are an integral part of most papers in the Geosciences and range from images of outcrops to abstracted summaries of observations to plots of measurements.

### Conference abstracts

These are generally a step on the path to a full research publication where results, interpretations, and context are publicly presented for the first time.

### Grant Applications

Scientific work is generally funded with public or private funds that are obtained by writing grants. Unlike research papers, grants must persuade reviewers that the research planned is important, can be done by the applicant, and can be achieved in the time frame of the funding request.

### Science Communication

Scientists also write general summaries of their work for non-specialist audiences. These can be blog posts, or lesson plans that are shared for educators. Some folks also write books for general audiences describing the processes of science.

## Common processes

For writing in the discipline, we focus on several specific questions to guide our composition:
1) Who is our audience?
2) What is the one or two sentence take-home point?
3) How quickly are we communicating the information?

Science writing, like all writing, is socially situated and caries with it the beliefs, values, and ideologies of the particular community and culture.

## Tips and tricks for good writing
Use a citation management software to organize your papers and create bibiliographies. My preference is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) because it is free, open source, and works across multiple operating systems.

Write and then revise. Ask for feedback from peers or wait until you have some distance from your writing and then revise.

Prompt yourself with questions that have short, concrete answers.

## Course and Teacher evaluation
Student input for the purpose of course improvement is taken very seriously and will potentially be done periodically. Please take the time to evaluate this course and the instructor, especially at the end of the semester. Evaluations will in no way affect your grade.

# Safety

## Field Safety

### Transportation
Wear your seatbelts at all times while in moving vehicles. Do not distract the driver.

### Location awareness
Be aware of potential dangers (animals, weather, etc) and avoid them. When in a group, please think about the safety of your peers.

## Building Safety

### Fire
Random fire safety drills may occur during the course of the term. You will be expected to evacuate the building and assemble at the designated location: outside by the northeast corner of the building (follow your instructor).

### Tornado
Move away from external windows to the hallway in the basement, first, or second floor. 

### Active Shooter Incident
"Get Out" of the building as long as they can do so safely. Once you have exited the building and are at a safe location, "Call Out" to law enforcement using 911, USA Police at 460-6312, or press the Emergency button on your LiveSafe Mobile Safety App. If you can't get out, "Shelter in Place" in a secure location that is away from windows and doors, preferably a location that can be locked and barricaded.

# Final thoughts

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is important, don't be afraid to ask a question about something you don't know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think you know.

__If this document is updated, a copy will be supplied to you via Canvas and changes will be announced in class.__
