# Course description

How does the Earth work as a system? In this class we will learn the basics of the science of Geology with a focus on physical processes and materials. We will cover major topics including: plate tectonics, mineral chemistry, the rock cycle, geological time, sedimentary processes, climate change, and geological map reading.

# Important Dates
January 15th - Last day to drop without WD\
April 7th - Last day to drop or withdraw\
May 3rd, 8-10 AM - In person final exam\
See the [Academic Calendar](https://www.southalabama.edu/academiccalendar/) for more information.

# Course goals

1.    Explain and apply the scientific method as it is practiced in the Geosciences
2.    Link observations of the Earth on multiple scales to the development of theories
3.    Explain how the hydrosphere, biosphere, and geosphere interact on multiple timescales and predict how changes in one can affect others
4.    Read and interpret topographic and geological maps
5.    Identify common minerals and rocks
6.    Link geological materials to Earth processes
7.    Relate facts about the Earth system to human problems


# Class textbook

We will be using the e-book of Exploring Geology by Stephen Reynolds and Julia Johnson. I chose this book because it has guided practice with readings and includes interactive web-based activities based on societally relevant problems related to Geology.


### Lectures and papers
Both lecture slides and supplemental readings will be available via Canvas. Slides will generally be posted after lecture.

# Student conduct

## Attendance policy

-   Students who complete less than 50% of assignments/exams will be assigned a failing (F) grade.

-   Review the 'Attendance and Absences Policy', in the Undergraduate and Graduate Bulletin for attendance and absences policy

## Grading

### Missing work
Everyone will have their lowest two discussion posts, readings, and quizzes dropped. This means that you have two weeks of built-in flexibility for life events that come up (e.g. illness, unexpected travel).

### Late work policy
If you need additional flexibility based on difficulties arising from life, please let me know. That said, given dropping the lowest two weeks worth of work means that I will not be allowing for late quizzes or discussion posts.

### Extra credit
Extra credit may be made available throughout the semester, but readings, quizzes, and discussion posts .

Assignments will be returned within a week of submission.

```{r Grades_Table, echo=FALSE}
kable(Grades,
      align = c("l", "r"))
```

Assignment weighting will follow:
```{r Weights_Table, echo=FALSE}
kable(Weights,
      align = c("l", "r"))
```

```

## Course and Teacher evaluation
Student input for the purpose of course improvement is taken very seriously and will potentially be done periodically. Please take the time to evaluate this course and the instructor, especially at the end of the semester. Evaluations will in no way affect your grade.

\newpage
# Safety

## Building Safety

### Fire
Random fire safety drills may occur during the course of the term. You will be expected to evacuate the building and assemble at the designated location: outside by the northeast corner of the building (follow your instructor).

### Tornado
Move away from external windows to the hallway in the basement, first, or second floor. 

### Active Shooter Incident
"Get Out" of the building as long as they can do so safely. Once you have exited the building and are at a safe location, "Call Out" to law enforcement using 911, USA Police at 460-6312, or press the Emergency button on your LiveSafe Mobile Safety App. If you can't get out, "Shelter in Place" in a secure location that is away from windows and doors, preferably a location that can be locked and barricaded.

# Final thoughts

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is important, don't be afraid to ask a question about something you don't know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think you know.

__If this document is updated, a copy will be supplied to you via Canvas and changes will be announced in class.__
