\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course description}\label{course-description}}

What can studying the history of Earth tell us about the future and the
present? In this course we will walk though major events in the history
of our planet and dive into the processes and peculiarities that caused
them. We will connect these events to places that matter to us and learn
about how their occurrence shapes life today. By the end of the semester
you will have a broad understanding of the science of Geology and its
application to studying how the Earth works.

\subsection{Attendance policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

Students who complete less than 50\% of assignments/exams will be
assigned a failing (F) grade. Review the `Attendance and Absences
Policy', in the Undergraduate and Graduate Bulletin for attendance and
absences policy.

Lectures can be attened in person or via Zoom. Recordings will be made
available by request.

\hypertarget{grading}{%
\subsection{Grading}\label{grading}}

\hypertarget{late-policy}{%
\subsubsection{Late policy}\label{late-policy}}

I will be grading assignments in batches to provide fair assessment to
everyone. This means late work can be disruptive. The penalty for late
work will be 20\% a day after the first 24 hours late. If you have a
reason (illness, etc.) the late policy will be relaxed.

\hypertarget{dropped-grades}{%
\subsubsection{Dropped grades}\label{dropped-grades}}

Two weeks worth of your lowest scores will be dropped at the end of the
semester. This means that the lowest two quiz scores, discussion posts,
and Tophat questions will be removed when calculating your final grade.

\hypertarget{extra-credit}{%
\subsubsection{Extra credit}\label{extra-credit}}

Extra credit may be made available throughout the semester at my
discretion.

Assignments will be returned within a week of submission.

\hypertarget{academic-disruption-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic disruption
policy}\label{academic-disruption-policy}}

The University of South Alabama's policy regarding Academic Disruption
is found in The Lowdown, the student handbook.
\url{http://www.southalabama.edu/lowdown/academicdisruption.shtml}.
Disruptive academic behavior is defined as individual or group conduct
that interrupts or interferes with any educational activity or
environment, infringes upon the rights and privileges of others, results
in or threatens the destruction of property and/or is otherwise
prejudicial to the maintenance of order in an academic environment. At
all times students will be cordial, courteous and respectful of faculty
members and fellow students. Cell phones, videotaping, and other
electronic devices are not allowed; however, you may use a laptop for
note taking. If your laptop is used for other purposes, the instructor
holds the right to revoke laptop use.

\hypertarget{academic-honesty}{%
\subsection{Academic honesty}\label{academic-honesty}}

The University of South Alabama's policy regarding Student Academic
Conduct Policy is found in The Lowdown
\url{http://www.southalabama.edu/lowdown/academicconductpolicy.shtml}:
The University of South Alabama is a community of scholars in which the
ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression,
and freedom of the individual are sustained. The University is committed
to supporting the exercise of any right guaranteed to individuals by the
Constitution and the Code of Alabama and to educating students relative
to their responsibilities.

Violation of academic conduct policy may result in receiving 0 credit
for the affected exam/assignment.

Do not pass others work off as your own. This constitutes plagiarism and
seriously undermines your education. Students may learn about the
meaning of plagiarism and how to avoid it at the following link:
\url{http://www.southalabama.edu/univlib/instruction/plagiarismforstudents.html}

\hypertarget{course-and-teacher-evaluation}{%
\subsection{Course and Teacher
evaluation}\label{course-and-teacher-evaluation}}

Student input for the purpose of course improvement is taken very
seriously and will potentially be done periodically. Please take the
time to evaluate this course and the instructor, especially at the end
of the semester. Evaluations will in no way affect your grade.

\hypertarget{safety}{%
\section{Safety}\label{safety}}

\hypertarget{building-safety}{%
\subsection{Building Safety}\label{building-safety}}

\hypertarget{fire}{%
\subsubsection{Fire}\label{fire}}

will be expected to evacuate the building and assemble at the designated
location: outside by the northeast corner of the building (follow your
instructor).

\hypertarget{tornado}{%
\subsubsection{Tornado}\label{tornado}}

Move away from external windows to the hallway in the basement, first,
or second floor.

\hypertarget{active-shooter-incident}{%
\subsubsection{Active Shooter Incident}\label{active-shooter-incident}}

``Get Out'' of the building as long as they can do so safely. Once you
have exited the building and are at a safe location, ``Call Out'' to law
enforcement using 911, USA Police at 460-6312, or press the Emergency
button on your LiveSafe Mobile Safety App. If you can't get out,
``Shelter in Place'' in a secure location that is away from windows and
doors, preferably a location that can be locked and barricaded.

\hypertarget{campus-resources}{%
\section{Campus resources}\label{campus-resources}}

\hypertarget{covid-policy}{%
\subsection{COVID policy}\label{covid-policy}}

While on campus, students are required to follow all USA COVID-19
policies and practices. These policies can be found at
\url{https://www.southalabama.edu/coronavirus/}. Be advised that
policies may change during the semester, and students should check the
University's Coronavirus Update page regularly.

would like additional guidance and critique. You can access the Writing
Center at
\href{https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/academicsuccess/cae/how.it.works.html}{at
their website}. During graduate school, I found workshops and writing
groups at the Writing Center on campus to be helpful in building my
motivation and teaching me new strategies for writing efficiently.

\hypertarget{disabilities}{%
\subsection{Disabilities}\label{disabilities}}

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, students with
bona fide disabilities will be afforded reasonable accommodations. The
Office of Special Student Services (OSSS) will certify a disability and
advise faculty members of reasonable accommodations. If you have a
specific disability that qualifies you for academic accommodations,
please notify the instructor/professor and provide certification from
the Office of Special Student Services. OSSS is located at 5828 Old
Shell Road at Jaguar Drive, (251-460-7212).

\hypertarget{food-insecurity}{%
\subsection{Food insecurity}\label{food-insecurity}}

If you are subject to food insecurity, JagPantry provides a food for

\href{https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/sga/foodpantry.html}{on
their website}

\hypertarget{mental-health}{%
\subsection{Mental health}\label{mental-health}}

Being a university student is stressful and can negatively impact mental
health. The University Counseling and Testing Center provides
confidential, free counseling and crisis intervention services to
eligible USA students and consultation and outreach services to members
of the USA community. More information can be found
\href{https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/counseling/}{at their
website}.

\hypertarget{disaster-plan}{%
\subsection{Disaster plan}\label{disaster-plan}}

In case of Hurricane we will follow university recommendations and
off-campus accommodations will be made. Our broad goals for the semester
will continue but mode of delivery and content may change.

In case of a shift to remote learning, we will heavily rely on Canvas.
We will have at least one synchronous lecture meeting that will be
recorded and made available through Canvas. We will use digital options
for rock samples and may also use \href{https://rockd.org/}{Rockd.org}
for local outcrop locations if we are dispersed.

\hypertarget{final-thoughts}{%
\section{Final thoughts}\label{final-thoughts}}

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth
together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value
data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this
course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is
important, don't be afraid to ask a question about something you don't
know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think
you know.

\textbf{If this document is updated, a copy will be supplied to you via
Canvas and changes will be announced in class.}
