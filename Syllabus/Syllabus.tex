\hypertarget{course-description}{%
\section{Course description}\label{course-description}}

How do fossils inform us about the history of life on Earth? In
Paleontology (GY401W) we will work on linking change in common marine
invertebrate fossils to change in environments and the mode and tempo of
evolutionary change. Our focus will include a survey of modern
paleontology research methods. Writing and conducting research will be
an important component of the class.

\hypertarget{writing-requirements}{%
\section{Writing requirements}\label{writing-requirements}}

For this class to fulfill the (W) requirements of USA, you will be doing
a semester-long research project in an area related to paleontology. To
build your skills in discipline-specific writing, we will be doing
smaller writing assignments throughout the semester. The final projects
will be peer-reviewed, revised, and then submitted for final grading and
assessment.

\hypertarget{important-dates}{%

policy}\label{academic-disruption-policy}}

The University of South Alabama's policy regarding Academic Disruption
is found in The Lowdown, the student handbook.
\url{http://www.southalabama.edu/lowdown/academicdisruption.shtml}.
Disruptive academic behavior is defined as individual or group conduct
that interrupts or interferes with any educational activity or
environment, infringes upon the rights and privileges of others, results
in or threatens the destruction of property and/or is otherwise
prejudicial to the maintenance of order in an academic environment. At
all times students will be cordial, courteous and respectful of faculty
members and fellow students. Cell phones, videotaping, and other
electronic devices are not allowed; however, you may use a laptop for
note taking. If your laptop is used for other purposes, the instructor
holds the right to revoke laptop use.

\hypertarget{academic-honesty}{%
\subsection{Academic honesty}\label{academic-honesty}}

The University of South Alabama's policy regarding Student Academic
Conduct Policy is found in The Lowdown
\url{http://www.southalabama.edu/lowdown/academicconductpolicy.shtml}:
The University of South Alabama is a community of scholars in which the
ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought, freedom of expression,
and freedom of the individual are sustained. The University is committed
to supporting the exercise of any right guaranteed to individuals by the
Constitution and the Code of Alabama and to educating students relative
to their responsibilities.

Violation of academic conduct policy may result in receiving 0 credit
for the affected exam/assignment.

Do not pass others work off as your own. This constitutes plagiarism and
seriously undermines your education. Students may learn about the
meaning of plagiarism and how to avoid it at the following link:

\hypertarget{on-writing}{%
\section{On writing}\label{on-writing}}

\hypertarget{revising-written-work}{%
\subsection{Revising written work}\label{revising-written-work}}

Nothing is perfect on the first draft. We all revise and rework our
written creations for a variety of reasons. We may not communicate the
point we want to get across to all readers. We may have forgotten or not
known important pieces of information initially. The tone of the writing
may be inappropriate for the audience. Word choice might obscure
meaning. The only way we can make our writing better is by revising it
based on constructive feedback from others or ourselves.

\hypertarget{genres-of-science-writing}{%
\subsection{Genres of Science writing}\label{genres-of-science-writing}}

\hypertarget{paper-reviews}{%
\subsubsection{Paper reviews}\label{paper-reviews}}

Critical but constructive critique of unpublished research papers.
Informs the journal editor of how the work contributes to existing
literature and provides guide to authors and the editor for improvement
to the manuscript. Can be signed but often anonymous.

\hypertarget{descriptive-reports}{%
\subsubsection{Descriptive Reports}\label{descriptive-reports}}

Descriptive reports are often made for industry or geological surveys.
These describe the composition and structure of rocks in an area.
Sometimes they include estimations of resource potentials or
environmental impacts of industry.

\hypertarget{research-papers}{%
\subsubsection{Research papers}\label{research-papers}}

These pieces of science writing typically test one or more closely
related hypotheses in the context of existing scientific knowledge. Most
have structure that is pre-defined including: abstract, introduction,
methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Figures are an integral
part of most papers in the Geosciences and range from images of outcrops
to abstracted summaries of observations to plots of measurements.

\hypertarget{conference-abstracts}{%
\subsubsection{Conference abstracts}\label{conference-abstracts}}

These are generally a step on the path to a full research publication
where results, interpretations, and context are publicly presented for
the first time.

\hypertarget{grant-applications}{%
\subsubsection{Grant Applications}\label{grant-applications}}

Scientific work is generally funded with public or private funds that
are obtained by writing grants. Unlike research papers, grants must
persuade reviewers that the research planned is important, can be done
by the applicant, and can be achieved in the time frame of the funding
request.

\hypertarget{science-communication}{%
\subsubsection{Science Communication}\label{science-communication}}

Scientists also write general summaries of their work for non-specialist
audiences. These can be blog posts, or lesson plans that are shared for
educators. Some folks also write books for general audiences describing
the processes of science.

\hypertarget{common-processes}{%
\subsection{Common processes}\label{common-processes}}

For writing in the discipline, we focus on several specific questions to
guide our composition: 1) Who is our audience? 2) What is the one or two
sentence take-home point? 3) How quickly are we communicating the
information?

Science writing, like all writing, is socially situated and caries with
it the beliefs, values, and ideologies of the particular community and
culture.

\hypertarget{tips-and-tricks-for-good-writing}{%
\subsection{Tips and tricks for good
writing}\label{tips-and-tricks-for-good-writing}}

Use a citation management software to organize your papers and create
bibiliographies. My preference is \href{https://www.zotero.org/}{Zotero}
because it is free, open source, and works across multiple operating
systems.

Write and then revise. Ask for feedback from peers or wait until you
have some distance from your writing and then revise.

Prompt yourself with questions that have short, concrete answers.

would like additional guidance and critique. You can access the Writing
Center at
\href{https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/academicsuccess/cae/how.it.works.html}{at
their website}. During graduate school, I found workshops and writing
groups at the Writing Center on campus to be helpful in building my
motivation and teaching me new strategies for writing efficiently.

\hypertarget{disabilities}{%
\subsection{Disabilities}\label{disabilities}}

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, students with
bona fide disabilities will be afforded reasonable accommodations. The
Office of Special Student Services (OSSS) will certify a disability and
advise faculty members of reasonable accommodations. If you have a
specific disability that qualifies you for academic accommodations,
please notify the instructor/professor and provide certification from
the Office of Special Student Services. OSSS is located at 5828 Old
Shell Road at Jaguar Drive, (251-460-7212).

\hypertarget{food-insecurity}{%
\subsection{Food insecurity}\label{food-insecurity}}

If you are subject to food insecurity, JagPantry provides a food for
students needing assistance. More information can be found
\href{https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/sga/foodpantry.html}{on
their website}

\hypertarget{mental-health}{%
\subsection{Mental health}\label{mental-health}}

Being a university student is stressful and can negatively impact mental
health. The University Counseling and Testing Center provides
confidential, free counseling and crisis intervention services to
eligible USA students and consultation and outreach services to members
of the USA community. More information can be found
\href{https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/counseling/}{at their
website}.

\hypertarget{disaster-plan}{%
\subsection{Disaster plan}\label{disaster-plan}}

In case of Hurricane we will follow university recommendations and
off-campus accommodations will be made. Our broad goals for the semester
will continue but mode of delivery and content may change.

In case of a shift to remote learning, we will heavily rely on Canvas.
We will have at least one synchronous lecture meeting that will be
recorded and made available through Canvas. We will use digital options
for rock samples and may also use \href{https://rockd.org/}{Rockd.org}
for local outcrop locations if we are dispersed.

\hypertarget{final-thoughts}{%
\section{Final thoughts}\label{final-thoughts}}

This document is a roadmap for our semester. We learn about the Earth
together and our individual experiences shape how we interpret and value
data. Like all your classes, you will get out what you put into this
course. Asking for help from one another and your instructors is
important, don't be afraid to ask a question about something you don't
know or if you want to check your knowledge about something you think
you know.

\textbf{If this document is updated, a copy will be supplied to you via
Canvas and changes will be announced in class.}
